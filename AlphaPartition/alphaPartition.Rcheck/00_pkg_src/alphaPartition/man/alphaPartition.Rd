\usage{
alphaPartition(x, pathNA = FALSE, recode = TRUE, unknown = NA,
  sort = TRUE, verbose = 1, profile = FALSE, printProfile = "end",
  pedType = "IPP", colId = 1, colFid = 2, colMid = 3,
  colPath = 4, colAGV = 5:ncol(x), colBy = NULL)
}
\arguments{
\item{x}{data.frame , with (at least) the following columns: individual, father, and mother identification,
and year of birth; see arguments \code{colId},
\code{colFid}, \code{colMid}, \code{colPath}, and \code{colAgv}; see also details about the validity of pedigree.}

\item{pathNA}{Logical, set dummy path (to "XXX") where path information is unknown (missing).}

\item{recode}{Logical, internally recode individual, father and, mother identification to
\code{1:n} codes, while missing parents are defined with \code{0}; this option
must be used if identifications in \code{x} are not already given as \code{1:n}
codes, see also argument \code{sort}.}

\item{unknown}{Value(s) used for representing unknown (missing) parent in \code{x}; this options
has an effect only when \code{recode=FALSE} as it is only needed in that situation.}

\item{sort}{Logical, initially sort \code{x} using \code{orderPed()} so that children follow
parents in order to make imputation as optimal as possible (imputation is performed
within a loop from the first to the last unknown birth year); at the end original
order is restored.}

\item{verbose}{Numeric, print additional information: \code{0} - print nothing, \code{1} - print
some summaries about the data.}

\item{profile}{Logical, collect timings and size of objects.}

\item{printProfile}{Character, print profile info on the fly (\code{"fly"}) or at the end (\code{"end"}).}

\item{pedType}{Character, pedigree type: the most common form is \code{"IPP"} for Individual, Parent
1 (say father), and Parent 2 (say mother) data; the second form is \code{"IPG"} for
Individual, Parent 1 (say father), and one of Grandparents of Parent 2 (say maternal
grandfather).}

\item{colId}{Numeric or character, position or name of a column holding individual identification.}

\item{colFid}{Numeric or character, position or name of a column holding father identification.}

\item{colMid}{Numeric or character, position or name of a column holding mother identification or
maternal grandparent identification if \code{pedType="IPG"} .}

\item{colPath}{Numeric or character, position or name of a column holding path information.}

\item{colAGV}{Numeric or character, position(s) or name(s) of column(s) holding Additive Genetic Values.}

\item{colBy}{Numeric or character, position or name of a column holding group information (see details).}
}
\description{
A function to partition additive genetic values by paths.
}
\details{
Pedigree in \code{x} must be valid in a sense that there are:\itemize{
\item{no directed loops (the simplest example is that the individual identification is equal to the identification of a father or mother)}
\item{no bisexuality, e.g., fathers most not appear as mothers}
\item{father and/or mother can be unknown (missing) - defined with any "code" that is different from existing identifications}
}

Unknown (missing) values for additive genetic values are propagated down the pedigree
so provide all available values from genetic evaluation. Another option is
to cut pedigree links - set parents to unknown and remove them from pedigree
prior to using this function - see \code{\link[alphaPartition]{pedSetBase}} function.
Warning is issued in the case of unknown (missing) values.

In animal breeding/genetics literature the model with the underlying pedigree type
\code{"IPP"} is often called animal model, while the model for pedigree type \code{"IPG"}
is often called sire - maternal grandsire model. With a combination of \code{colFid}
and \code{colMid} mother - paternal grandsire model can be accomodated as well.

Argument \code{colBy} can be used to directly perform a summary analysis by
group, i.e., \code{summary(alphaPartition(...), by="group")}. See \code{\link[alphaPartition]{summary.alphaPartition}}
for more. This can save some CPU time by skipping intermediate steps. However,
only means can be obtained, while \code{summary} method gives more flexibility.

\examples{
## Small pedigree with additive genetic (=breeding) values
ped <- data.frame(  id=c(  1,   2,   3,   4,   5,   6),
                   fid=c(  0,   0,   2,   0,   4,   0),
                   mid=c(  0,   0,   1,   0,   3,   3),
                   loc=c("A", "B", "A", "B", "A", "A"),
                   gen=c(  1,   1,   2,   2,   3,   3),
                  trt1=c(100, 120, 115, 130, 125, 125),
                  trt2=c(100, 110, 105, 100,  85, 110))

## Partition additive genetic values
tmp <- alphaPartition(x=ped, colAGV=c("trt1", "trt2"))
print(tmp)

## Summarize by generation
summary(tmp, by="gen")

## There are also two demos
demo(topic="alphaPartition_deterministic", package="alphaPartition", ask=interactive())
demo(topic="alphaPartition_stochastic",     package="alphaPartition", ask=interactive())
